## Overview

Balm for Minecraft 1.21.4 has introduced a load context for Forge.

## Notable Additions and Changes

### Balm now expects a `ForgeLoadContext` on Forge

You must change your Forge entrypoint to pass in a `ForgeLoadContext` with the mod event bus from your `FMLJavaModLoadingContext`.

```java
public ForgeWaystones(FMLJavaModLoadingContext context) {
    final var loadContext = new ForgeLoadContext(context.getModEventBus());
    Balm.initializeMod(Waystones.MOD_ID, loadContext, Waystones::initialize);
}
```
