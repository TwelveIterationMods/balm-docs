## Initializing your Mod

Your mod loader entrypoints will reference your mod's main class. This class usually just has a static `initialize(BalmRegistrars registrars)` method that you can use to register all content in your mod and define any event handlers you need.

```java [common/src/main/java/Waystones.java]
public class Waystones {
    public static final String MOD_ID = "waystones";

    public static void initialize(BalmRegistrars registrars) {
        // Register your content using the methods on the registrars instance
        // e.g. registrars.blocks(ModBlocks::initialize);

        // Register event handlers for any of Balm's common callbacks
        ServerPlayerCallback.Join.EVENT.register(player -> {
            System.out.println("Player " + player + " has just joined the game!");
        });
    }
}
```
