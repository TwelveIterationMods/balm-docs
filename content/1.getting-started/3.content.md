Content, such as Blocks and Items, is registered using helpers you can access through the `BalmRegistrars` instance that is passed to your [initializer](/getting-started/mod). Balm provides various convenient helper methods for registering standard content, as well as the ability to register into any other registry using the generic `registrar(...)` method.

```java [common/src/main/java/Waystones.java]
public class Waystones {
    public static DeferredBlock waystoneBlock;

    public static void initialize(BalmRegistrars registrars) {
        registrars.blocks(registrar -> {
            waystoneBlock = blocks.register("waystone", WaystoneBlock::new, it -> it.sound(SoundType.STONE).strength(5f, 2000f)).withItem(WaystoneBlockItem::new).asDeferredBlock();
        });
    }
}
```

### Structuring your Content

As your mod grows, it often makes sense to split content registrations into their own classes depending on their type.

```java [common/src/main/java/ModBlocks.java]
public class ModBlocks {
    public static void initialize(BalmBlockRegistrar blocks) {
        blocks.register(registrar -> {
            waystoneBlock = blocks.register("waystone", WaystoneBlock::new, 
                it -> it.sound(SoundType.STONE)
                        .strength(5f, 2000f)
            ).withItem(WaystoneBlockItem::new).asDeferredBlock();
        });
    }
}
```

```java [common/src/main/java/Waystones.java]
public class Waystones {
    public static void initialize(BalmRegistrars registrars) {
        registrars.blocks(ModBlocks::initialize);
    }
}
```

## Caveat: Deferred Registrations

In a multi-loader context, registrations are not necessarily instant across all loaders.

While Fabric registers content the moment you make the call, NeoForge and Forge defer registrations until a later time.

That's why anything you register with Balm will generally either provide you with a `Holder`, or something like `DeferredBlock` or `DeferredItem` rather than the `Block` or `Item` directly.

Many Minecraft methods accept `Holder`s (or Balm's `DeferredBlock` and `DeferredItem` classes) just fine, but if you need to, you can access the underlying values using `Holder.value()` or e.g. `DeferredBlock.asBlock()`.

`DeferredBlock` also comes with a useful `defaultBlockState()` method (since that is what you most commonly need a `Block` field for), and both `DeferredBlock` and `DeferredItem` have a `createStack(int count)` method to quickly get a new `ItemStack` of them.

::note
Be careful not to access the underlying values too early, i.e. before the game has finished loading, or your mod may crash on NeoForge and Forge.
::

::note
Avoid equality checks such as `itemStack.getItem() == ModItems.warpStone`, as they will always be false when using `DeferredItem`. Use `itemStack.is(ModItems.warpStone)` instead, or consider using an Item Tag where it makes sense.

## Using other Registries

The most common registries are covered by specialized `Balm...Registrar` classes which not only provide useful helpers for registering things in a neat and streamlined manner, but may also take care of additional steps in the background that are needed to make your content function. Therefore, if Balm provides a specialized registrar for the registry you need, you should use it to avoid issues.

For registries that are not covered by Balm, you can use the custom registrar method instead:

```java [common/src/java/main/ModSounds.java]
public class ModSounds {
    public static Holder<SoundEvent> fridgeOpen;

    public static void initialize(BalmRegistrar.Scoped<SoundEvent> sounds) {
        fridgeOpen = sounds.register("fridge_open", SoundEvent::createVariableRangeEvent);
    }
}
```

```java [common/src/java/main/CookingForBlockheads.java]
public class CookingForBlockheads {
    public static void initialize(BalmRegistrars registrars) {
        registrars.registrar(Registries.SOUND_EVENT, ModSounds::initialize);
    }
}
```
