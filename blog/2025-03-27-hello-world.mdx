title: Balm is now Open Source

Balm is now licensed under Apache 2.0, with the official binaries continuing to be distributed as All Rights Reserved.

It was already visible-source before, which may have mislead some into thinking it was open source all along, but now it's official.

I was hesitant to make this change due to prior bad experiences with being too permissive when it came to my work, 
but I think this is a good compromise that should help Balm grow and make it a more reliable choice for mod developers.

When Balm started out, I specifically discouraged its use by others because I didn't want to carry the responsibility of downstream mods breaking 
should I make any changes, but I quickly realized that with me being a massive downstream consumer myself (20+ mods) I would have to be careful with breaking changes either way.

I think there's a place for Balm's simplistic approach to Multi-Loader and it seems like a few people agree, so consider this my official welcome and invitation to try out Balm.

I decided to keep the logo and official binaries licensed under All Rights Reserved so that CurseForge moderation would still keep its checks in place for 
project names and mod pack overrides, but there are now no longer any restrictions that would stop anyone from continuing Balm under new branding should the need arise.

:::tip
There's a [template repository](https://github.com/TwelveIterationMods/balm-mod) for creating new mods with Balm, and while documentation may currently be lacking, I have [20+ visible-source mods](https://github.com/TwelveIterationMods) you can steal code from.
