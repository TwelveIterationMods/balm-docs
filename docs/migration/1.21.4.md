# Minecraft 1.21.4

:::info
These migration notes cover only the changes made to Balm APIs. 

For Minecraft and mod-loader specific migrations, check out their respective release announcements or primers.
:::

## Overview

Balm for Minecraft 1.21.4 has introduced a load context for Forge.

## Notable Additions and Changes

### Balm now expects a `ForgeLoadContext` on Forge

You must change your Forge entrypoint to pass in a `ForgeLoadContext` with the mod event bus from your `FMLJavaModLoadingContext`.

```java title="Example on NeoForge"
public ForgeWaystones(FMLJavaModLoadingContext context) {
    final var loadContext = new ForgeLoadContext(context.getModEventBus());
    Balm.initializeMod(Waystones.MOD_ID, loadContext, Waystones::initialize);
}
```
