# Minecraft 1.21.9

:::info
These migration notes cover only the changes made to Balm APIs. 

For Minecraft and mod-loader specific migrations, check out their respective release announcements or primers.
:::

## Overview

In Minecraft 1.21.9, some deprecated methods regarding to de/serialization have been removed. Key categories are now a record instead of a plain string, and are now namespaced.

## ⚠️ Known Issues

### `/balm export icons` is not yet functional

The command has not yet been updated to Minecraft's rendering changes.

## Breaking Changes

### `BalmKeyMappings.registerKeyMapping` now takes a `KeyMapping.Category` instead of a string

Minecraft provides a static `register` method to create these. Consider using [Kuma](https://github.com/TwelveIterationMods/KumaAPI) instead, which is embedded in Balm.

### Kuma's `overrideCategory` now takes a `KeyMapping.Category` instead of a string

Minecraft provides a static `register` method to create these.

### Kuma's default key category is now `{modId}.default` (i.e. `key.categories.{modId}.default`)

You will have to update your language files. This is because Minecraft now uses resource locations instead of plain strings for key categories.

### `Balm.lookupAllModPaths` has been removed in favor of `Balm.visitModResources`

This was necessary as NeoForge no longer provides `Path`s for mod resources. The visitor receives a `ModResource` object for every item under the given path, which can be used to read the file (equivalent to doing `Files.walk` on the returned paths previously).

While `lookupAllModPaths` looked up paths in all loaded mods and returned them mapped by mod id, `visitModResources` expects a mod id to be passed in. You can get a list of all loaded mod ids using `Balm.getLoadedPrimaryModIds`. This will only return real mod ids, it does not include "provided" ids by Fabric mods.

### `Balm.lookupModPath` has been removed in favor of `Balm.lookupModResource`

As above, this will now return an optional `ModResource` object instead of a `Path`.

## Removals 

### `DefaultContainer.deserialize` and `DefaultContainer.serialize` has been removed in favor of `ContainerHelper.loadAllItems` and `ContainerHelper.saveAllItems`

Use `net.minecraft.world.ContainerHelper#loadAllItems(ValueInput, NonNullList)` and `net.minecraft.world.ContainerHelper#saveAllItems(ValueOutput, NonNullList)` instead, which are identical.

### `ImplementedContainer.deserializeInventory` and `ImplementedContainer.serializeInventory` have been removed in favor of `ContainerHelper.loadAllItems` and `ContainerHelper.saveAllItems`

Use `net.minecraft.world.ContainerHelper#loadAllItems(ValueInput, NonNullList)` and `net.minecraft.world.ContainerHelper#saveAllItems(ValueOutput, NonNullList)` instead, which are identical.

### `DefaultFluidTank.deserialize` and `DefaultFluidTank.serialize` methods based on `CompoundTag` have been removed in favor of their `ValueInput` and `ValueOutput` variants 

Use the methods of same name that take a `ValueOutput` or `ValueInput` instead.

### `DefaultEnergyStorage.deserialize` and `DefaultEnergyStorage.serialize` have been removed in favor of their `ValueInput` and `ValueOutput` variants

Use the methods of same name that take a `ValueOutput` or `ValueInput` instead. Note that, unlike the removed methods, these methods write into an `"Energy"` key instead of returning an `IntTag` directly. You may have to migrate data manually if you want to support upgrading older worlds.
